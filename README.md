## üìå Project Overview

In today's digital era, recommending relevant content is crucial for user retention and satisfaction on streaming platforms like Netflix or Prime Video. This system integrates **three recommendation techniques**:

1. **Popularity-Based Filtering**
2. **Collaborative Filtering** (using SVD)
3. **Content-Based Filtering** (using genre similarity)

A final **hybrid model** merges these methods to deliver top recommendations for each user.

## üß† Techniques Used

### 1. Popularity-Based Filtering
- Uses IMDb-style weighted average formula
- Ranks movies based on rating count and average rating

### 2. Collaborative Filtering (SVD)
- Learns latent features from user-item interactions
- Predicts user ratings for unseen movies

### 3. Content-Based Filtering
- Uses one-hot encoding on genres
- Recommends movies similar to those a user has already liked

### 4. Hybrid Recommendation
- Combines the output scores of all three models
- Produces a refined top-N recommendation list per user
